<p>Since 1978, AFS has provided foster care, mental health, and adoption services to thousands of Northern California youth and families. </p> 
<p>The holiday campaign is a way you can help AFS meet the following goals for the hundreds of foster youth and families in our care:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Raise $25,000 and 3,000 gifts to ensure:
        <ul>
            <li>every youth 12 and younger receives a gift valued between $25-$75</li>
            <li>every youth 13 and older receives a gift card and small gift valued between $25-$75</li>
            <li>every bio-sibling living in a household with a youth in care receives a small gift, so they don't feel left out</li>
            <li>Please consider sharing the holiday campaign with your friends, family and colleagues. </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
